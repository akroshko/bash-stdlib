cic-bash-common: A collection of useful Bash library functions
==========================================================

This package provides general-purpose Bash functions that I have
written to support my computing projects.

Requirements
============

This package has mostly been tested on *Debian Linux 9.0
(Stretch)*. There many additional packages required for substantial
functionality (not just aliases) can be installed by the command:

    sudo apt-get install alsa-utils autossh bc cpufrequtils cups-bsd emacs25 eyed3 fail2ban ffmpeg git imagemagick liblz4-tool libnotify-bin lzip lzop nmap pdftk python-pygments rxvt-unicode-256color rzip screen smartmontools sqlite3 unzip vlc wmctrl xclip xdotool xz-utils zip

There are also some minor helper functions that may require other
packages.
